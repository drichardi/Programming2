  Answer the questions by writing code to satisfy the Expected
  results.  The first function - Question1() - has been defined
  already, and called inside of main().  Follow this format for
  the remaining questions.

  ** NOTE ** Your functions should have the static modifier in order
  to compile if you call the function without creating a javaExercises
  object.  You may import any libraries you wish in order to complete
  the questions.

  NAME:

  Question 1: Write a function to print the result of the
              following operations:

              Test Data:
              a. -5 + 8 * 6
              b. (55 + 9) % 9
              c. 20 + -3 * 5 / 8
              d. 5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3

              Expected Output:
              43
              1
              19
              13

/*
  Question 2: Write a function that asks the user for two numbers
              and prints the sum, multiplies, subtracts, divides, and
              the remainder of the two numbers (modulus).

              Test Data:
              First number: 125
              Second Number: 24

              Expected Output:
              125 + 24 = 149
              125 - 24 = 101
              125 x 24 = 3000
              125 / 24 = 5
              125 mod 25 = 5

/*
  Question 3: Write a function that takes a number as input and
              print its multiplication table up to 10.

              Test Data:
              Input a number: 8

              Expected Output:
              8 x 1 = 8
              8 x 2 = 16
              8 x 3 = 24

/*
  Question 4: Write a function to print the area and perimeter
              of a circle with a radius input by the user.

              Radius = 7.5

              Expected Output:
              Perimeter is = 47.12388980384689

/*
  Question 5: Write a function that swaps the values of 2 integer variables
              Use the given function declaration.

              Expected Output:
              Before swapping : a, b = 15, 27
